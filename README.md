This is my own library which uses javax.mail. My library simplifies the sending of mails using Java.

All the decription of the functions and constructor is included as Javadoc in the code itself.

## Note

Your must have javax.mail and javax.activation jar files downloaded. [javax.activation is not used in the library but it is required for the program to work otherwise it won't work.]

The jar files must be added to your project.

> In your google security setting please turn ***```on```*** **Less security app access** for this to work otherwise the mail won't be sent.
